# CyberIntelGPT: LLM-Driven IOC Extraction & Enrichment with SIEM & TIP-Ready Outputs

## üìå Project Overview


**CyberIntelGPT** is a cybersecurity automation project designed to streamline the extraction and enrichment of **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** from unstructured **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** reports. Leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, the project automates the identification of relevant IOCs and enriches them through public intelligence services such as **VirusTotal** and **IBM X-Force Exchange**.

The extracted and enriched data is then formatted for seamless integration with industry-standard security tools, including **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** solutions and **Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)**.

---

## Key Workflow

This project reflects a typical industry-standard threat intelligence pipeline used within SOC (Security Operations Center) environments and CTI teams:

1. **Extraction**  
   Using LLM-based models to extract IOCs from raw CTI reports (PDFs, unstructured text).

2. **Enrichment**  
   Supplementing extracted IOCs with additional context from public intelligence services like VirusTotal and IBM X-Force Exchange.

3. **Preparation for Ingestion**  
   Preparing the output in two formats:
   - **Flattened CSV**: Suitable for SIEM tools such as Splunk, QRadar, etc.
   - **STIX JSON**: Suitable for sharing through TIPs such as MISP, Anomali, IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Platform, or even CERTs and ISACs.

---

## Why This Workflow?

This project demonstrates a realistic, industry-aligned workflow for operationalizing threat intelligence:

- **LLM-Based Automation** reduces manual analysis time when processing large CTI reports.
- **Public Enrichment Services** provide lightweight but valuable context without requiring costly enterprise licenses.
- **Output Standardization** aligns the data with existing security tooling and workflows for correlation, detection, and threat hunting activities.

## üí° How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Extraction
- Extracts IOCs from PDF CTI reports using OpenAI GPT API (LLM-based extraction).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Enrichment
- Enriches IOCs using:
  - **VirusTotal API** (Free version provides meaningful enrichment)
  - **IBM X-Force Exchange API** (Free version provides limited/no enrichment)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Outputs
- **Flattened CSV** for SIEM tools (Splunk, QRadar, etc.)
- **STIX JSON** for Threat Intelligence Platforms (MISP, etc.)

## üí¨ Important Notes
- **X-Force outputs are placeholders for demo only**. Limited enrichment due to freemium API.
- **VirusTotal outputs are meaningful and demonstrate the enrichment phase.**
- All API keys used are **free tier** except OpenAI, which requires **$1-2 credit**.

## üõ†Ô∏è What to Modify for Your Project

| File               | What to Change                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| `config/config.yaml` | API keys (keep secret, not committed) |
| `input/`           | Place your own CTI reports      |
| `output/`          | Output paths as per your needs  |

## üîç Project Gap Addressed

**Gap:** Unstructured CTI reports ‚Üí SIEM/TIP-ready structured outputs.  
**Problem:** Manual parsing of CTI reports is inefficient, error-prone, and lacks scalability. SIEM and TIPs require structured inputs.

**How This Project Bridges It:**
- Automates extraction from CTI reports using LLMs.
- Provides machine-ingestible, enriched outputs ready for operational use (CSV for SIEM / STIX for TIP).
- Bridges the gap between CTI analysts and operational security tooling with clarity, speed, and accuracy.
